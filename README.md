## Description

Welcome to my Tetris game, written in Python! This classic puzzle game challenges your skills in arranging falling blocks (tetrominos) to create complete lines without any gaps. The objective is to clear as many lines as possible to score points and prevent the blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen.

I developed this Tetris game as a fun and educational project to practice Python programming and enhance my skills in game development. The game is built using simple graphics and a straightforward user interface, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced players.

Enjoy the nostalgia of this timeless classic and have fun playing!

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay experience.
- Simple and intuitive controls.
- Scoring system to track your progress.
- Gradually increasing game speed to challenge your skills.
- Sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- Pause and resume functionality for convenience.

## Installation

To run the Tetris game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tetris-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the game directory:

   ```
   cd tetris-game
   ```

3. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

4. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Play

1. Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can launch the game by running:

   ```
   python tetris.py
   ```

2. The game window will open, and you will be presented with the main menu.

3. Use the arrow keys (left, right, down) to move and rotate the falling tetromino. You can also use 'A', 'D', and 'S' keys for left, right, and down movements, respectively.

4. Your goal is to arrange the falling tetrominos to fill complete lines across the game board. When a line is completed, it will be cleared, and you will earn points.

5. The game will gradually increase in speed, adding to the challenge as you progress.

6. The game ends when the tetrominos stack up to the top of the game board, and there's no more space for new pieces.

7. Your high score will be saved, and you can try to beat it in subsequent games.

## Controls

- Left Arrow Key (or 'A' Key): Move the tetromino to the left.
- Right Arrow Key (or 'D' Key): Move the tetromino to the right.
- Down Arrow Key (or 'S' Key): Move the tetromino down faster.
- Up Arrow Key (or 'W' Key): Rotate the tetromino clockwise.
- P Key: Pause the game.
- Q Key: Quit the game.
